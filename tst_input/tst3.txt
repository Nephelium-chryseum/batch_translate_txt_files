The first challenge of fast DLD screening via SA evaluation is the elaborate design of inducing procedures and evaluation scales. For the design of speech-inducing procedures, the conventional stimulus materials that rely highly on reading texts (6,10,11) may lead to test failure (which denotes that the children give no responses for the stimulus materials) on young children, since they usually have an immature language system and nonstandard speech characteristics. For the design of evaluation scales to screening DLDs, the comprehensive test should evaluate an extensive range of linguistic aspects (e.g., pronunciation accuracy for the low-level aspect and logical consistency for the high-level aspect). Based on the above consideration of the first challenge, we propose a novel comprehensive inducing procedures (CIP) and the relevant comprehensive CIP indicators (scales) that are specifically designed for DLD screening. To avoid test failure and induce the childrenâ€™s full speech performance sufficiently and effectively, the stimulus materials are audio-visual in nature with no reliance on texts. The inducing procedures cover a broad range of difficulties from easy to hard by elaborately controlling the word choices, sentence length, grammar, and semantic complexity. For a comprehensive evaluation, not only the inducing procedures cover a full variety of speech modalities including repetition, restatement and free conversation, but also the relevant comprehensive CIP indicators cover an extensive range of linguistic aspects; i.e., pronunciation, expression efficiency, fluency grammar, semantic and logic.
