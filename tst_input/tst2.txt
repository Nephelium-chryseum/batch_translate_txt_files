For screening DLDs, we argue that a comprehensive evaluation of the children’s speech ability (SA) plays a core role since the SA is the most important indicator for language development (3,4) and covers a broad range of language abilities for children. Specifically, SA is defined as proficiency in oral language, which includes the ability to repeat or retell properly, pronounce correctly and fluently, and express grammatical and logical content. Usually, SA is evaluated based on a collection of the subject’s responses of some specific speech-inducing procedures prompted by a professional (5-9). To the best of our knowledge, few studies have focused on comprehensive SA evaluation for children’s DLD screening, since it is incredibly challenging. In this paper, we attempt to address these difficulties and provide a feasible solution by designing a fast screening framework based on the deep learning technology.
