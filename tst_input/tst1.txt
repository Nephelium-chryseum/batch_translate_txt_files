Developmental language disorders (DLDs) are the most common developmental disorders in children with a prevalence of 5â€“8% in preschool (1,2). Most children with DLDs suffer various speech disorders (e.g., pronunciation or comprehension obstacles), which lead to other social and behavioral abnormalities (e.g., dyslexia, communication disorders, autism, and attention deficit disorder). Screening for DLDs in young children is extremely important and necessary to take precautionary measures and treat development disorders effectively.
