The second challenge of fast DLD screening is the traditional high reliance on professionals, which is expensive, subjective and time-consuming. To achieve fast and accurate screening, we specifically designed a novel deep framework to automatically rate the responses of the inducing procedures in CIP according to the SA performance and created a CIP dataset with about 2,200 responses from over 200 children. The automated CIP rating is very challenging due to the comprehensive (multi-aspect) nature of evaluation and the large variance of responses (Var-Resp) caused by the broad range of modalities and the varied speech performances of the children. For the former (multi-aspect evaluation), a two-stream architecture was proposed, utilizing the complementary features from the pronunciation stream (for low-level aspect) and content stream (for high-level aspect). For the latter (Var-Resp), an excellent-comparison architecture was proposed, which evaluates the response by comparing it with the excellent responses (i.e., the response with the highest rating). The model is procedure-aware and excellent-aware, which alleviates the Var-Resp problem.
