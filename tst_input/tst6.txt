DLDs are the most common developmental disorder in childhood. The early detection of language disorders has come to be recognized as a crucial step in achieving the best possible outcome for the affected children (12-14). For DLD screening, language evaluation scales are used (1,3,15-17). Most of these scales-based tests suffer the problems of insufficient SA evaluation. For example, in Rescorla (17), the language survey consists of a vocabulary checklist designed to screen DLDs, but it only focuses on one type of childrenâ€™s language disorder, namely, vocabulary development delay, ignoring many other disorders (e.g., pronunciation obstacles and communication disorders). Also, the checklist is completed by the parents, causing a large subjective bias or instability. The Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF) is also a commonly used test battery for the diagnosis of DLDs only suitable for evaluating children aged five years and above (18). The scale-based tests also suffer from a professional-reliant limitation; i.e., they require speech and language therapists (SLTs) or speechlanguage pathologists (SLPs). Due to these obstacles, it is very challenging to distinguish a potential disorder from the normal course of development in young children, and there is often subjective bias and instability.
