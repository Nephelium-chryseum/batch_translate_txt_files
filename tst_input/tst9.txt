in Zechner et al. (25) and Xie et al. (26), the authors used indicators mostly in the fluency domain to build an automated scoring system for non-native speech. The previously proposed indicators were not suitable for our setting since the SA evaluation between the patient and the healthy subject is considerably different. Specifically, DLD children present SA evaluation with a unique challenge: the evaluators must differentiate between fundamental speech disorders and perceived difficulties resulting from an individualâ€™s normal developing speech differences. Differences may be expressed in sentence structure, speech sound production, vocabulary, and pragmatics (27). To achieve this, we argue that a comprehensive evaluation is essential. Our evaluation indicators consider various levels of language features and speech aspects (see Table 2).
