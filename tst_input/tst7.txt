Inducing procedures Many SA inducing procedures have been proposed. Some (5-7) induce the speech based on texts (e.g., asking the subjects to read fixed texts). However, for young children aged 2 to 8, text-based procedures can lead to test failure, since most children at these ages are illiterate. Some (8,9) induce the speech based on word or sentence repeating tasks, which can be conducted uniformly. However, such tasks restrict the children’s full language performance and fail to observe aspects of their high-level speech abilities such as semantics and logic, which are important for screening DLDs. To address the above challenges (test failure and incomplete evaluation) of the SA inducing procedures design, we propose the CIPs, as shown in Figure 1 . The CIP stimulus is based on audiovisual materials (e.g., recordings, pictures, and videos) and is specifically designed according to children’s cognitive abilities to avoid test failure. To avoid incomplete evaluation, the CIP covers a large range of speech modalities and difficulties, and can induce subject responses effectively from various linguistic aspects. A comparison of CIP with the commonly used SA inducing procedures is shown in Table 1.
